// a generator appears to be a function but it behaves like an iterator.
// Generators are a special class of functions that simplify the task of writing iterators.
// A generator is a function that produces a sequence of results instead of a single value,
//  i.e you generate â€‹a series of values.

//  Remember that every function implicitly returns undefined if no return statement is provideds
